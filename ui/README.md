Thanks to [cubbie/icuc-assignment](https://github.com/cubbie/icuc-assignment), without this project we would have spent a lot more time figuring out how to tie preact + testing + typescript together.

Thanks to Robert Cooper for posting [this article describing ESLint setup in a TypeScript project](https://www.robertcooper.me/using-eslint-and-prettier-in-a-typescript-project).
